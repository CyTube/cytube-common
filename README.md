cytube-common
=============

This library provides common modules that are shared between the next generation
CyTube frontend and backend daemons.  It has not yet been tested for production
use; it is under development as part of the ongoing project to split backend and
frontend responsibilities in CyTube.  The API may change at any time while the
version number precedes `1.0.0`.
